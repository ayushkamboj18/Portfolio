        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a third-year Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for technology and innovation. I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and am currently diving into Docker to enhance my containerization skills. With a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms using C++, I love solving complex problems. I'm always eager to learn and stay updated with the latest tech trends, whether it's exploring new frameworks or contributing to open-source projects. Let's connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€
